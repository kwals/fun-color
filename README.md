# fun-color

I'm making this app along with the tutorial found in the Pragmatic Programmer RubyMotion book. It takes a hex number for a color, and sends it to the Colr api to get information. The version of the tutorial I am using still uses BubbleWrap's HTTP function which has since been deprecated, so I have instead created an API class to take use the NSURLSession function.
